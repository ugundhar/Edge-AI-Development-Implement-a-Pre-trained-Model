# Image Classification with Pre-trained MobileNet Model

This repository contains code for performing image classification using a pre-trained MobileNet model. The MobileNet model is a deep learning architecture that has been trained on a large dataset and can classify images into multiple categories with high accuracy.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version 2.x)

You can install the required packages by running the following command:


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:


2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Place your images in the `images` directory:

   - Create a new folder within the `images` directory for each set of images you want to classify.
   - Place the images you want to classify in their respective folders.

4. Run the image classification script:


5. The script will analyze and classify the images using the pre-trained MobileNet model. The results will be displayed in the console, and the classified images with labels will be saved in the `output` directory.

## Customization

- You can modify the `image_urls` list in the `image_classification.py` script to include your own image URLs for classification.
